# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 21 August 2025

This privacy policy applies to the iOS app **Anytime Recall** (the "App") developed and published by **William Grimm**.

## Information We Collect

We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.
All app settings, scanned barcode information, and recall results are stored locally on your device or, if you enable iCloud Sync, within your personal iCloud account. No accounts, sign‑ins, or personal‑identifier tracking are used.
## Camera & Photo Access

The App requests access to your camera solely to scan barcodes or QR codes.
You may optionally select images from your photo library to detect barcodes; images are processed on-device and never leave your device. No photos, videos, or scan results are uploaded to any server.
## Network & External Services

When you perform a product or recall search, the App sends only the scanned barcode or product identifier to public databases (e.g., FDA, NHTSA, UPCItemDB, OpenFoodFacts).
These requests do not contain personal information and are used exclusively to retrieve product or recall details.
The App does not use analytics services, advertising networks, or tracking technologies.
## iCloud Sync & Backups

If you opt in to iCloud Sync, the App uses Apple’s CloudKit to store your data in your private iCloud container. Apple’s servers host this data, but it remains associated with your Apple ID and is not accessible to the developer.
Push notifications may be used purely to trigger synchronization; they carry no personal data.
You can export or import your records as JSON files for personal backup—these files remain under your control.
## Data Sharing

We do not collect or share personal data with third parties. Any network requests made to public product or recall databases contain only the barcode or product identifier you choose to search. No usage analytics or marketing data is transmitted.
## Children’s Privacy

The App is rated 4+ and may be used by children. It does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information from users of any age.
## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will update the version posted in the App and on the App Store. Please review this policy periodically for the latest information.
