**RAW Gallery - Privacy Policy**

*Last Updated: July 11, 2025*

## Overview

RAW Gallery ("we," "our," or "the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.

**Key Point: RAW Gallery does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or user information.**

## Information We Do NOT Collect

RAW Gallery does not collect, store, or transmit:
- Personal information (names, emails, phone numbers)
- Location data
- Usage analytics or statistics
- Device identifiers
- Photos or image data
- Any other personal or sensitive information

## Photo Library Access

### What We Access
RAW Gallery requests access to your photo library solely to:
- Display RAW format photos stored on your device
- Allow you to view these photos in full-screen mode
- Enable export of RAW photos as JPEG files

### How We Use Photo Access
- All photo processing occurs locally on your device
- No photos are uploaded, transmitted, or stored outside your device
- The App only reads RAW photo files from your library
- Export functionality saves processed images directly to your device's photo library

### Your Control
You can:
- Grant or deny photo library access at any time
- Revoke access through iOS Settings > Privacy & Security > Photos
- Use the App only with the photos you choose to view

## Data Processing

### Local Processing Only
All image processing and data handling occurs entirely on your device:
- RAW photo decoding happens locally using iOS Core Image
- EXIF data reading is performed on-device
- No data is sent to external servers or services

### No Remote Storage

## Children's Privacy

RAW Gallery does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. Since we collect no personal information whatsoever, the App is safe for users of all ages.

## Data Security

While we don't collect any data, we implement security best practices:
- All processing occurs locally on your device
- No network connections are made for data transmission
- iOS security features protect your photo library access

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect any data, traditional data rights (access, deletion, portability) don't apply. However, you have complete control over:
- Whether to grant photo library access
- Which photos to view in the App

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in the App and on our website. Continued use of the App after changes indicates acceptance of the new policy.
